### [Sort a Linked List of 0s, 1s and 2s] (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-duplicates-from-a-sorted-linked-list/)
Topic: Linked List  
Difficulty: Easy

**Optimal Approach**

- Time Complexity: *O(n)*
- Auxiliary Space: *O(1)*

```java
static Node sortList(Node head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) 
            return head; 

        Node zeroD = new Node(0); 
        Node oneD = new Node(0); 
        Node twoD = new Node(0);
        
        Node zero = zeroD, one = oneD, two = twoD; 
        Node curr = head; 
        while (curr != null) { 
            if (curr.data == 0) { 
                zero.next = curr; 
                zero = zero.next; 
            }else if (curr.data == 1) { 
                one.next = curr; 
                one = one.next; 
            }else { 
                two.next = curr; 
                two = two.next; 
            } 
            curr = curr.next; 
        } 

        zero.next = (oneD.next != null) ? (oneD.next) : (twoD.next); 
        one.next = twoD.next; 
        two.next = null; 
          
        head = zeroD.next; 

        return head; 
    }

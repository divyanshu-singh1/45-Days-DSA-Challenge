### [Flatten a multilevel Doubly Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/)
Topic: Linked LIst  
Difficulty: Medium

**Recursive Approach**

- Time Complexity: *O(n)*
- Auxiliary Space: *O(n)*

```java
class Solution {
    public Node flatten(Node head) {
        Node dummy = new Node(-1)                                                ;
        Node curr = head;
        dummy.next = curr;

        while(curr != null){
            
            if(curr.child != null){
                Node next = curr.next;
                Node child = curr.child;
                Node returned = flatten(curr.child);
                
                curr.next = returned;
                returned.prev = curr;

                curr.child = null;

                while(curr.next != null){
                    curr = curr.next;
                }
                curr.next = next;
                if(next != null)next.prev = curr;
            }

            curr = curr.next;
        }
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```


**Optimal Iterative Approach**

- Time Complexity: *O(n)*
- Auxiliary Space: *O(1)*

```java
class Solution {
  public Node flatten(Node head) {
    for (Node curr = head; curr != null; curr = curr.next)
      if (curr.child != null) {
        Node cachedNext = curr.next;
        curr.next = curr.child;
        curr.child.prev = curr;
        curr.child = null;
        Node tail = curr.next;
        while (tail.next != null)
          tail = tail.next;
        tail.next = cachedNext;
        if (cachedNext != null)
          cachedNext.prev = tail;
      }

    return head;
  }
}
```
